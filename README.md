# Color Palette Maker
This little site is just a basic tool for finding a set of colors that look good together. It is quite bare-bones, and is intended for use in early development when you aren't sure worried about committing to anything but needs a color palette that looks halfway decent to start visualizing things.
### How to Use
Get started by clicking randomize until you see a couple colors you like. If you already have some colors in mind or prefer to pick colors manually, click the color preview icon. When hovering on a color card, click the plus between it and the next card to add the color in between them. Click the X to delete a card, and the arrows to rearrange cards. Click the hex color code to copy that color to your clipboard.
